WILL

This project is an online dApp that allows users to create a will for their
Ethereum funds. Users can connect via Metamask,  (hardware wallet functionality
will be added in the future), and add funds to the contract. The user can add
more funds into the contract at any time.

The user will decide who the recipients will be by inputting their addresses,
and can adjust the percentage of the total funds that each address will receive.
The user must also designate an "executor" by address who will be the person
to officially declare that the user has died. This person must visit the web site
and only their Metamask account will be able to execute the will and send funds.
